gbAsm.pl - A Gameboy CPU assembler in perl.

The actual assembling works, no label support, + bugs on num prefices (0x,$)

I was happy to see other very different assemblers written in Perl or
any other 'script' like simple assemblers, please mail me such references,
it could be useful to have an index of such assemblers somewhere.
